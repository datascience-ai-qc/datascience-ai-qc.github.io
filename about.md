## About QC DataScience & AI Club
Queens College DataScience and AI Club aims to cover the popular fields
of computer science such as artificial intelligence and data science.
As we all know these two fields are really popular at the moment due to the rise 
of big data. 

## GOALS
- In this Club I aim to cover technologies such as Keras,TensorFlow,Pytorch,SciKit Learn and etc,
- We will also cover data visualiztion frameworks such as `D3js`,`Plotly`,`Seaborn` and etc.
- Furthermore, Don't be afraid we will cover math but we will not go into much detail. We will be covering Statistics and a little bit of Calculus.
- Lastly we will cover latest tools such as Jupyter Notebook and other tools that are used in Data Science and AI.


## What do I need to know 
- To be honest In order to be part of this club you just need to be Passionate.
