title: What's Data Science
---
In Simplest terms, Data Science can be defined as obtaining insights and valuable 
information from huge amounts of useful data.For instance, UPS can use data to save fuel,
Youtube can use data to recommend videos to its user and there are countless examples of
companies using data to derive useful insights.





### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as a foundation for creating Jekyll themes. Poole-based themes, such as BlackDoc here, include the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### BlackDoc Features

In addition to the features of [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), BlackDoc theme adds the following:

* Scrolling sidebar with a thin scrollbar to allow displaying of numerous top-level content.
* Elements and classes of the Hyde theme were updated to look great in black background. Check out the [Theme Styles](styles) to see the stylings used in the theme.
