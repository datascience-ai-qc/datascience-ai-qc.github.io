title: What's Data Science
---
In Simplest terms, Data Science can be defined as obtaining insights and valuable 
information from huge amounts of useful data.For instance, UPS can use data to save fuel,
Youtube can use data to recommend videos to its user and there are countless examples of
companies using data to derive useful insights.

Data Science can be divided into three different parts.

- Data Visualization/Analysis
- Data Science/Machine Learning 
- Data Engineering.


# Data Visualization/Analysis
Data Analysis is the first step of Data Science. In this step data analyst use tools such as `Python`,`SQL` or `R` to aggregate and manipulate data.
Data Analysis allows us to clean up the data using these tools so later it can be used to derive useful insights using Machine Learning.Furthermore, after cleaning up
data it can also be visualized in order to make it look beautiful.

# Data Science/Machine Learning
This is the next step after cleaning up data. Once we have the useful data then it can be used for machine learning algorithms such as Logistical Regression,Linear Regression,
Classification And Regression Trees and etc.

# Data Engineering
In simplest terms Data Engineering is role that makes sure that organization is using the right data for analysis.This can include building data pipelines and making sure that
company is using clean data for the task. Furthermore, We will not cover much about this but it's good to have an insight.
